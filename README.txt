 Compile by typing: javac <file name>.java
 Then run:

 > java KMP <textfile.example> <pattern>

 NOTE: IF YOU WANT A PATTERN THAT HAS SPACES, THEN ENCLOSE YOUR PATTERN WITH QUOTES
 	EX: "This is an acceptable pattern"

=====================

If you want to run a simulation with multiple trials, I included a python script

testScript.py

Run it by typing

./testScript.py <input file> <pattern>

Before it executes, it will ask you how many trials you want it to do
